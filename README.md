# OCR System - End of Study Internship Project

This repository contains the code and report of the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system I developed during my end of study internship project. The OCR system was custom-made for a specific type of documents used by the startup I interned at. Due to confidentiality reasons, I have presented the outputs without the actual documents used. I will make other documents for the demo, to replace the outputs as well since they contain confidential information too.

## Repository Contents

1. `final_OCRsystem_code.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the main and part of the final code of the OCR system developed using AWS Textract (What is permitted to be shared publically).

2. `tesseract_trial.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the code used to test the Tesseract solution implemented with the Img2table library for table extraction. It was part of a comparative study between AWS Textract and Tesseract.

3. `Report-PFE-FinalVersion_ZakariyaeELKHALDI.docx`: This Word document is the final report of my end of study internship project. It contains the entire workflow of the project, including the steps I followed and the coding process I underwent to achieve the final solution. It needs further modifications concerning some elements of its structure, the final verison would be uploaded once it's ready.

## Technology Stack

The technology stack for the project mainly consists of:

- AWS Textract for text extraction
- Tesseract OCR engine along with Img2table library for table extraction

The codes are implemented in a Jupyter notebook for ease of presentation of the outputs.

## Usage 

These notebooks can be run on any system with Python installed. Required Python libraries can be installed from `requirements.txt` file (if provided). For proper execution, AWS credentials must be correctly set up if running the AWS Textract notebook.

Please note that due to the custom nature of this project for specific document types used by the startup I interned at, the success and accuracy of the OCR system may vary for different types of documents.
